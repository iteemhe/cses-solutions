# Misc

---

This folder contains my template, clangd config and also Makefile I use to compile code.

I use `clangd` as Language Server, `lldb` as primary debugger, `make` as build system, `clang++` as primary compiler. Besides, because I use `clang++`, `bits/stdc++.h` is not part of standard header files, I manually copied one from `gcc` and commented out incompatible header files with macOS.

In addition, I highly recommend use `Vim` for coding.
